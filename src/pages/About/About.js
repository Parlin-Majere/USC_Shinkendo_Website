            Shinkendo is not a sport but an enriching martial art that focuses on practical and effective technique, strengthening the body, cultivating the mind and spirit, and overall developing strong and capable individuals. In addition to the technical curriculum, students can expect rigorous instruction in traditional etiquette, philosophy, strategy, and history.
